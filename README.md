PROCESSING
To perform tasks firstly we have to do some modification and valuations in that dataset,they are;
*Data exploration
print("Data Exploration:")
print(df.info())
print("\n\nSample Data:")
print(df.head())
print("\n\nNull values in columns:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
This code snippet performs data exploration by printing out information about the DataFrame, including its structure and sample data, and then checks for null values in each column and displays the count of null values in each column. This helps in understanding the dataset's structure, content, and any missing values present, providing an initial overview of the data
*Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180. Ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with analysis.
To correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180, we can follow these steps using Python and pandas:
-Import the necessary libraries.
-Load the dataset.
-Generate random numbers between 150 and 180.
-Replace the values in the "height" column with the generated random numbers.
-Ensure data consistency and integrity.
Here ,the code will load the dataset, replace the values in the "height" column with random numbers between 150 and 180, and ensure data consistency and integrity. Finally, it will display the first few rows of the modified dataset.The  code utilizes the np.random.randint() function from the NumPy library to replace the values in the "height" column of a DataFrame with random integers between 150 and 180, ensuring data consistency and integrity before further analysis.

TASKS:
1.Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees data isight
In this analysis, we aim to understand the distribution of employees across different teams within the ABC company dataset. By examining the proportion of employees in each team relative to the total number of employees, we gain insights into the workforce distribution and team composition within the company. This information can help management make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, team management, and overall organizational strategy.Then, we calculate the distribution of employees across each team and express it as a percentage relative to the total number of employees. The proportions were then calculated and presented, showing the percentage of employees belonging to each team.
Here is the distribution of employees across some of the teams:
New Orleans Pelicans: 4.15%
Memphis Grizzlies: 3.93%
Utah Jazz: 3.49%
New York Knicks: 3.49%
Milwaukee Bucks: 3.49%

Toronto Raptors: 3.28%
Philadelphia 76ers: 3.28%
Dallas Mavericks: 3.28%
Orlando Magic: 3.06%
Minnesota Timberwolves: 3.06%
These percentages provide insights into the workforce composition and distribution within the organization, facilitating resource allocation, team management, and strategic decision-making.

2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
To segregate employees based on their positions within the company, we can group the dataset by the "Position" column and then analyze the distribution of employees across different positions. This allows us to understand the composition of the workforce in terms of job roles and responsibilities.
Additionally, we can calculate the count or percentage of employees holding each position to gain insights into the organizational structure and hierarchy. This analysis helps in identifying the diversity of roles within the company and may provide valuable information for human resource management and talent development strategies.
By segregating employees based on their positions, the company can effectively manage recruitment, training, performance evaluation, and career progression programs tailored to the specific needs and requirements of different job roles. This approach facilitates better workforce planning and organizational effectiveness.
The segregation of employees based on their positions within the company reveals the following distribution:
Shooting Guards (SG): 102 employees
Power Forwards (PF): 100 employees
Point Guards (PG): 92 employees
Small Forwards (SF): 85 employees
Centers (C): 79 employees
This breakdown provides insights into the composition of the workforce in terms of different job roles or positions held within the company. Such segmentation is essential for understanding the distribution of responsibilities, skill sets, and expertise across various positions, thereby facilitating effective human resource management and organizational planning.

3. Identify the predominant age group among employees.
Identifying the predominant age group among employees, particularly within the 20-30 age range, is essential for gaining insights into the demographic composition of the workforce and tailoring organizational
strategies accordingly. This demographic profile indicates a considerable segment of the company's employees are in the early to mid-career stages, which can significantly influence various aspects of the
organizational culture, communication dynamics, and employee engagement initiatives. Recognizing this age group's prevalence allows human resources departments to design policies, benefits, and programs that resonate with the needs and preferences of younger employees, such as flexible work arrangements, career development opportunities, and wellness initiatives. Moreover, it underscores the importance of offering robust career development paths and succession planning strategies to nurture talent within this age bracket, ensuring their long-term engagement and growth within the organization. Additionally, understanding
the age demographics aids in refining recruitment strategies to attract diverse talent pools and aligning organizational goals with the aspirations and expectations of employees across different age groups. Overall, acknowledging the predominant age group among employees facilitates effective workforce management, fosters employee satisfaction, and contributes to the company's long-term success and sustainability.

4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure
The analysis of salary expenditure across teams and positions reveals valuable insights into the financial dynamics within the company. Firstly, the data indicates that the Cleveland Cavaliers team has the highest salary expenditure among all teams, suggesting that it either employs a higher number of individuals or compensates its employees more generously compared to other teams. This insight can guide management in assessing the distribution of financial resources across teams and ensuring equitable compensation practices company-wide. Moreover, understanding which team incurs the highest salary expenses 
enables the organization to delve deeper into the factors driving these costs, such as player salaries, coaching staff compensation, or administrative expenses, allowing for more targeted financial management strategies and budget adjustments.
Secondly, the analysis identifies the Center (C) position as having the highest salary expenditure, indicating that individuals occupying this role command higher salaries relative to other positions within the company. This finding underscores the importance of key positions within the organizational structure and highlights the need for competitive compensation packages to attract and retain talent in critical roles. By recognizing which positions contribute the most to salary expenses, the company can tailor its talent acquisition and retention strategies accordingly, ensuring that compensation levels remain competitive while aligning with the organization's overall financial objectives. Additionally, this insight may prompt further exploration into the factors influencing salary differentials across positions, facilitating discussions around pay equity, performance-based incentives, and talent development initiatives to optimize human capital management practices.

5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.
To investigate the correlation between age and salary, a scatter plot can be utilized to visually represent the relationship between these two variables. Each data point on the scatter plot represents an employee's age and corresponding salary. By observing the pattern of the scatter plot, we can discern whether there is a positive, negative, or no correlation between age and salary.
Additionally, a correlation coefficient such as Pearson's correlation coefficient can be calculated to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between age and salary. A correlation coefficient close to +1 indicates a strong positive correlation (as age increases, salary also tends to increase), while a coefficient close to -1 suggests a strong negative correlation (as age increases, salary tends to decrease). A coefficient near 0 indicates little to no linear correlation between the two variables.
Visualizing the correlation between age and salary and interpreting the correlation coefficient will provide insights into whether there is a discernible relationship between these two factors among the employees in the dataset. This analysis can inform decision-making processes related to salary structures, employee compensation, and workforce planning strategies within the organization.

CONCLUSION
Upon further analysis, it becomes apparent that the distribution of employees across teams reflects the company's operational structure and possibly its strategic focus. Teams like the New Orleans Pelicans, with higher proportions of employees, might indicate a larger department or a team with diverse functions. Conversely, teams with lower representation, such as the Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves, could signify smaller departments or teams with specialized roles. Understanding these variations can aid in resource allocation, team management, and organizational planning.
Similarly, the breakdown of employee positions sheds light on the composition of the workforce and the roles critical to the company's operations. The dominance of shooting guards and power forwards suggests a heavier emphasis on roles requiring athleticism and scoring ability, which could be indicative of the company's industry or operational requirements. Conversely, the lower representation of centers might imply a lesser emphasis on roles requiring physical presence or defensive capabilities. This insight can inform talent acquisition strategies, training programs, and succession planning efforts.
Moreover, the identification of the predominant age group among employees underscores demographic trends within the workforce. A concentration of employees between the ages of 20 and 30 may indicate a youthful and dynamic workforce, potentially contributing to innovation, adaptability, and agility within the organization. Understanding the age demographics can guide HR initiatives, such as leadership development programs, mentorship opportunities, and diversity and inclusion efforts tailored to different age groups' needs.
Furthermore, the analysis of salary expenditure across teams and positions provides critical insights into the organization's financial dynamics and talent investment strategies. Teams with higher salary expenditures may indicate areas of strategic importance or high-performance expectations, warranting closer attention to talent management and performance evaluation practices. Similarly, positions with higher salary expenditures, such as centers, may reflect the value placed on specific skill sets or the scarcity of talent in certain roles, necessitating competitive compensation packages and retention efforts.
Lastly, exploring the correlation between age and salary unveils potential patterns in career progression, compensation structures, and organizational hierarchies. A positive correlation between age and salary suggests that employees tend to earn higher salaries as they gain experience and tenure within the company. This insight highlights the importance of career development opportunities, performance-based incentives, and fair compensation practices to retain and motivate employees at different stages of their careers.
A comprehensive understanding of these insights enables ABC Company to make data-driven decisions in areas such as talent management, resource allocation, and organizational development, ultimately fostering a more productive, engaged, and competitive workforce.
